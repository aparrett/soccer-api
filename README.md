# soccer-api
A GraphQL wrapper on a soccer (football) REST API. The REST API documentation can be found [here](https://www.api-football.com/documentation#teams-data-requests). **Beware: this API is currently using the DEMO version of the original API so it has its limitations.**

### Intended Use
This project is currently only being used for learning how to wrap a REST API with GraphQL but feel free to make PRs, comment suggestions, or use the API. Obviously it is not recommended to use this in a production environment.
